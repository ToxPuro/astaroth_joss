# Summary

Stencil computations[^stencil_footnote] are one of the bedrocks of high-performance scientific simulations, forming the core of many partial differential equation (PDE) and numerical linear algebra solvers. 
In recent years, GPUs have become the primary compute platform for data-parallel applications in high-performance computing, and it is difficult to run large simulations without them.
`Astaroth` is a GPU framework for stencil computations, that has been developed to address this problem of scalable scientific computing.
`Astaroth` provides its own domain specific language (DSL), in which researchers can express such computations without having to focus on technical implementation details.
It can run efficiently both on CUDA- and HIP-based environments --- and even on hardware lacking GPUs, e.g. for testing purposes.
While stencils are the core of `Astaroth`, it also accelerates other operations like reductions (e.g. sums), simple ray-tracing, and integrates with libraries performing GPU-accelerated Fourier transforms, all of which are important for simulations on structured grids.
`Astaroth` is optimized for multiphysics use cases and has primarily been used for turbulent astrophysical plasma simulations.

# Statement of need

Much of the software used for scientific computing is written for CPUs, and has
to be ported to GPUs to run larger problems with decent times-to-solution.
`Astaroth` has been developed to solve this problem for the subset of
scientific software that relies heavily on stencil computations.
`Astaroth`'s domain specific language (DSL) can be used to rewrite existing PDE solvers or to write
completely new ones.
As an example, `Astaroth` has been used to write a partial differential equation (PDE) solver for astrophysical
plasma simulations [@vaisala2023exploring], which scales to thousands of GPUs with a weak scaling
efficiency \>90% [@pekkila_graphicsprocessors_2026]. 

Accelerating such simulations was the original reason for the creation of
`Astaroth`.
A widely used framework for them is the `Pencil Code` [@brandenburg2020pencil],
which is a modular multiphysics PDE and particle dynamics solver.
A prototype of `Astaroth` focused on accelerating 
high-order finite-difference methods for isothermal hydrodynamics, as employed by `Pencil Code`, on GPUs
[@pekkila2017methods;@vaisala_magneticphenomena_2017]. 
The `Astaroth` framework for general stencil computations took shape in [@pekkila_masters_2019] with the introduction of the DSL, code generator, and multilayer API.
With later revisions, `Astaroth` has successfully been used to accelerate `Pencil
Code` [@puro2023programmatic], achieving speedup factors of 20-60 [@pekkila2022scalable].
Of course, `Astaroth`'s PDE solver is not limited to astrophysics, and neither
is `Astaroth` limited to PDEs.
As an example, many image processing techniques, like edge detection and
convolutions, are stencil operations.

Methods to achieve performance portability in stencil computations have been widely studied.
Domain-specific languages for image processing include `Halide` [@ragan2013halide] and `Polymage` [@mullapudi2015polymage].
Autotuning code-generation frameworks include `Patus` [@christen_patuscode_2011] and `PARTANS` [@lutz_partansautotuning_2013].

More generalized software that provides the building blocks for domain-specialized libraries also exist:
`Delite` [@sujeeth_delitecompiler_2014] and `Lift` [@steuwer_liftfunctional_2017] provide intermediate languages as targets for domain-specific languages; <!--% JP (can be left out if no room) -->
`Kokkos` [@trott2021kokkos] and `RAJA` [@beckingsale2019raja] provide abstraction layers for parallel computational patterns but focus on single-node computations;
`Chapel` [@callahan_cascadehigh_2004] and `Charm++` [@kale_charmportable_1993] provide programming models for parallel and distributed computations;
In a more specialized approach, the `Cactus` framework [@goodale_cactusframework_2003] provides a collection of functionalities shared between computational tasks.
We refer the reader to [@pekkila_graphicsprocessors_2026] for more details.

Closest to `Astaroth` is `Parthenon` [@grete_parthenonperformance_2023], a distributed framework for adaptive mesh refinement using `Kokkos` as the backend for intra-node computations.
In contrast, `Astaroth` provides a DSL and an optimizing code generator for implementing the computations akin to `Halide`, `Polymage`, and `Patus`.

A distinctive feature of `Astaroth` is its specialization for cache-constrained use cases, especially in multiphysics simulations where the values of interdependent fields need to be held in working memory at the same time. Additionally, `Astaroth` does not only consider stencils in isolation, but also their combinations with other operations inside the same kernel, such as distributed reductions.
`Astaroth` also supports multiple different physics cases. 

# Software design

`Astaroth` consists of three main components: 1) `acc`, a compiler and runtime system for a domain-specific language (DSL) for stencil computations, 2) an API for executing stencil applications on multi-GPU platforms, and 3) a standalone PDE solver.
Below, we present a quick overview of these components. Extensive documentation is available at [@astaroth_doc]. 

## `acc` compiler and runtime system

`Astaroth` has a DSL for stencil-based computations, designed to be used by domain scientists without having to consider technical implementation details.
The main operations, such as stencils, are written in a declarative syntax, and the kernels that use them are written in an imperative syntax.[^paradigm_footnote]
The implementation is left to `Astaroth`'s DSL compiler `acc`, which applies a number of specialized optimizations. 
An especially important optimization is the unrolled and reordered computation of all required stencils at the start of the kernels, which enables instruction-level parallelism and efficient usage of caches [@pekkila_graphicsprocessors_2026].
In addition to stencils, the DSL supports two other operations: 1) multi-GPU reductions -- which are commonly needed for stencil-based solvers; and 2) simplified distributed ray-tracing, where rays cannot change directions and are restricted to move through neighbouring grid points -- which is necessary for simulations incorporating radiative transfer [@heinemann2006radiative].
`Astaroth`'s DSL also includes a standard library, providing, inter alia: derivative operators used in PDE solvers, implemented for generally spaced Cartesian, spherical or cylindrical grids; and Poisson solvers, e.g. for self-gravity [@krasnopolsky2026iterative].

`acc` transpiles the DSL source into CUDA or HIP source code, which is further compiled into machine code using a native CUDA or HIP compiler.
The program thus produced is executed in the `acc` runtime system, which further optimizes the kernels by autotuning the thread block sizes for kernel execution.
`acc` also supports run-time compilation, because run-time configuration parameters may change the evaluation of conditional statements, thereby changing the branches taken at run-time.
With run-time compilation, `acc` compiles for a given configuration only those parts of the DSL source that will be executed.
The information of what code gets executed also allows `Astaroth` to optimize run-time behaviour more precisely, e.g. memory allocations or communication patterns.

## Multi-GPU runtime system and API

In the DSL, using the `ComputeSteps` language construct, users can define a list of compute steps specifying a sequence of kernels and boundary conditions.
Kernels defined in `ComputeSteps` may be fused to reduce memory reads.
Based on the overall domain decomposition and the stencils' data access patterns, `acc` infers the dependency relationships between the steps, and constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependent tasks.
Each step is split into many tasks, one per region: there are 26 smaller regions at each subdomain's boundaries, which are dependent on communicated data from neighbors; and one big region at the core of the subdomain, which is not.
Communication tasks are inserted where needed.

`Astaroth`'s task scheduler executes these DAGs, asynchronously launching computation and communication tasks when prerequisite tasks are completed.
This improves performance in communication-bound cases, especially for higher process counts [@lappi2021task].
For fast data transfers and to support all possible hardware, both GPU-to-GPU remote direct memory access (RDMA) and CPU-to-CPU communication are supported.

This runtime system can be accessed through `Astaroth`'s runtime API.
The API is C-ABI compatible, supporting foreign function interfaces to external applications written in any programming language.
The API is organized into two layers: the `Device` layer and the `Grid` layer.
The `Device` layer provides access to single-GPU functionality, such as: moving data between CPU and GPU, launching kernels, and loading/storing snapshots from/to disk.
The `Grid` layer provides access to multi-GPU functionality, such as: executing DAGs, distributed initialization, and distributed loading/storing of snapshots.
Other special functionality is also provided through the API, such as distributed Fourier transforms.

## Solver

`Astaroth` also includes a standalone finite-difference PDE solver [@pekkila2022scalable], which takes full advantage of the DSL and the multi-GPU API, and can be used to write new simulation models.
It also works as a testbed for performance research.
This solver uses an astrophysical magnetohydrodynamical setup (`acc-runtime/samples/mhd_modular`) by default, but can be configured to run any DSL code.
The samples directory also includes other production-ready setups, e.g. `tfm-mpi` for the test-field method [@pekkila_graphicsprocessors_2026].

The solver handles distributed initial conditions, domain decomposition, simulation diagnostics, and logging.
It is also designed to react to a number of events, such as NaNs in the simulation data, simulation time limits, and a stop signal given through the file system.
The directory `analysis/` contains Python-based data analysis tools, which can be used to process and work with the data produced by the standalone solver. 


# Research impact statement

`Astaroth` has already been used in a number of papers as the core PDE-solver, mainly for astrophysical plasma simulations [@vaisala2021interaction; @vaisala2023exploring; @gent2026asymptotic], but also in seismology [@ladino2025acoustic]. 
Additionally, it has been used for research on performance optimization methods[@pekkila_graphicsprocessors_2026;@pekkila2025stencil;@pekkila2017methods], communication techniques [@pekkila2022scalable;@lappi2021task], compiler techniques [@pekkila_masters_2019;@puro2023programmatic] and other topics [@yokelson2024soma; @puro2025gpu].
We expect that the recent GPU-acceleration of `Pencil Code`, which was done by embedding `Astaroth`'s DSL and runtime system into it, will increase the number of `Astaroth` users.
The associated speedup factor of 20-60 will enable more realistic astrophysical simulations in a wide range of use cases from modelling small-scale dynamos [@warnecke2025small] to processes producing primordial gravitational waves and their propagation [@roper2020numerical].
